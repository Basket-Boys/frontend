An intense 1 vs 1 typing game that draws inspiration from Typeracer and Tetris. Send "garbage" to the other person by typing perfectly in quick succession - and clear your garbage by making "combos".

## Rules of the game

- Your goal is to eliminate your opponent by preventing

## Tech stack used

### Front End

- React (create-react-app)

### Back End

- Express to host a simple http server.

### Others

We used Socket.io to handle web sockets, which allowed us to manage real-time communication between our front-end and our back-end.

## Resources used

To get our words, we used [this](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt) wordlist from Stanford.

## Some challenges we faced

- Getting Web sockets to work properly
- Having to jump a lot between the React front-end and the Express back-end
- Having to convert an entire component to a class-based one to fix a problem

## What we're proud of
- First time using Web Sockets to build a working project
- 0 external modules for UI!
- Organised and neat code
